# 🏡 Pura Domus

## 📌 About The Project

**Pura Domus - Clean Home**

We believe that members of a household should live together harmoniously. That’s why we created this application—to help distribute and share household responsibilities more efficiently.
The **Pura Domus** is a full-stack web application designed to help households manage their shared responsibilities efficiently. Users can create tasks, assign them to household members, schedule them in a calendar, and track progress. The application ensures seamless collaboration and accountability within a household.

### ✨ Core Features
- **User Authentication** (Login, Registration, Logout, Session Management)
- **Household Management** (Create, Join, Leave, Delete Households)
- **Task Management** (Create, Assign, View, Delete Tasks)
- **Task Scheduling** (Weekly, Monthly, Daily Recurring Tasks)
- **User Role and Permissions** (Admin, Member, Guest)
- **Interactive Calendar** (Displays tasks and schedules)
- **Automated Task Assignment**
- **RESTful API** for backend communication
- **Responsive UI** with light and dark modes
